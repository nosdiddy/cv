<!--How to keep your html file neat and tidy. Many programmers are very serious
on how to indent and structure their html cos it makes it easy for us to see at
at a glance, which tags are inside other ones.Looking above, it shows that the
head is inside the html elements same as the body. But the body and the head are
in the same level so that are not inside each other. The h1 is contained inside
the body element. Indenting can be do automatically on atom: go to packages and
go to Atom Beautify click on beautify and it is sorted out immediately. P tag is
the paragraph tag, the text forms a new line and are grouped together
the <em></em> emphasis element and it marks text that has a stress emphasis
and it italicized the text. The <i></i> element does the same thing. The little
difference between them is that the em tag tells the browser the words that are
enclosed between the should be stresses or emphasized but the i tag only
italicizes the text. For this reason, it is better to use the em tag instead of
the i tag the b tag (Bold tag) is like the i tag. it bolds any text inbetween
it the strong tag does same job and its better to use the strong tag-->

<!-- Read up html list on google searching with "html list mdn" to learn
more/ Image element is a self closing element and the image source is
important that can either be a url so it can fetch it from the internet
or it can be a local image saved to the same directory as your website.
look for an image on internet click the source link eg twitter right click on
the image and copy the image address. past it to the web link and click enterand
the browser fetches the image from that location. copy the url link and add it
your website as a HTML element just above h1 this depends on where you want the
image to show up. At the end of the image link, you will see "alt"and this is
if a browser can't render the image then it will simply display an alternative
text to the user to describe what the image was all about. In this case,
we just type Destiny profile pic. Note: iF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SEARCH ENGINE
OPTIMIZATION AND GETTING YOUR WEBSITE RANKING FOR CERTAIN KEY WORDS, THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT GOOGLE LOOKS AT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR WEBPAGE IS about
IF YOU ARE MAKING A WEBPAGE ABOUT HOTELS AND YOU ADD AN ALT TEXT THAT SAYS
FURNISHED APARTMENTS IMAGE1 THAT MAKES GOOGLE THAT YOUR WEBSITE IS about
LODGING AND ACCOMONDATION

If you do not have a picture on the internet, you can create an account on
photobucket and upload your own picture in order to get a url. Right click
on the image and copy the image address.

The disadvantage of using a url link for your image source is that if that
site hosting the image url shots down, your image will no longer be available.
To remove reliance on the url, you can also put an image into your html
personal site folder. Ensure that index.html and yourimage.png are in the
same folder You can crop your image into a circular format usning
crop-circle.imageonline.com
There are several attributes you can add to the image element such as size,
etc -->
